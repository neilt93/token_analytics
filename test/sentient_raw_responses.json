Solana's SOL [SOL$152.35](/price/solana) posted 2%-4% gains, supported by strong inflows and improving sentiment.\n  - **Coindesk**: Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP ETFs See Record AUM as Traders Warn of \u2018Summer Lull\u2019. Solana's SOL ETF brought in $22 million, and total ETF assets under management reached an all-time high of $188 billion.\n  - **Blockworks**: Solana ETF bump fizzles after $161 price spike. SOL prices hovered around $152, and the network processed over 2.1 billion successful transactions in June.\n  - **Blockworks**: L1s are overpaying for security, but change is coming. Solana attempted to cut SOL inflation but the proposal was unsuccessful. However, key on-chain metrics suggest a potential bullish reversal.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n- **On-Chain Metrics and Network Activity**:\n  - **Total Value Locked (TVL)**: $10.9 billion, surpassing the entire Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem.\n  - **30-Day Fee Revenue**: Increased by 109% to $43.4 million.\n  - **SOL Perpetual Futures Funding Rate**: At 8%, indicating strong leverage demand from bulls.\n  - **Daily Active Addresses**: Showed significant growth, with some reports indicating a threefold increase to as high as 15.39 million.\n  - **Capital Inflows**: Turning positive with 4-5% growth, signaling renewed investor optimism.\n\n- **Price and Market Outlook**:\n  - Despite recent fluctuations, key on-chain metrics suggest a potential bullish reversal.\n  - The anticipation of a spot SOL ETF could prompt a price recovery.\n  - However, increasing short positions and technical resistance may challenge further upward momentum.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe 30-day analysis of Solana's on-chain metrics and network activity indicates a robust and expanding ecosystem. With significant increases in TVL, fee revenue, and daily active addresses, Solana is poised for potential growth. However, market fluctuations and external factors such as regulatory announcements and global economic trends will continue to influence the price and overall health of the Solana network. Investors should remain cautious but optimistic, considering the positive on-chain indicators and the potential impact of a spot SOL ETF. ",
