A strong uptrend would yield a higher percentage, while a strong downtrend would cause a lower percentage.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Without day-by-day price and MA data, a precise number cannot be given from the search results.\n- Given that SOL experienced mixed momentum, it is reasonable to estimate (based on general chart behavior and provided trends[2][3]) that **SOL closed above its 7-day moving average on approximately 40\u201360% of the days in the last 30-day period**, though the exact figure could differ depending on the exact price action over those days.\n\nFor full accuracy, you would need to reference historical daily close values and compute the 7-day moving average for the relevant period[1][3].",
