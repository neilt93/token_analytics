The results primarily give partial SOL/ETH conversion rates and some day-by-day changes in the first half of July[1][3], but not both assets' USD closes side-by-side.\n\nTo accurately answer, you would need:\n- The daily closing price for SOL in USD from June 9 to July 8, 2025\n- The daily closing price for ETH in USD for the same period\n- With this, you would count the days when both assets' closing price was higher than the prior day, then divide by 30 to get the percentage.\n\nFrom the partial data provided:\n- For the first 10 days of July 2025, there are several days when SOL/ETH rates increased, but this does not directly map to both USD closing prices rising simultaneously[1][3].

  "pct_days_tao_vol_gt_2x_avg": "Available search results do not provide a full 30-day history of TAO's daily trading volumes or specifically the number of days when daily volume exceeded twice its 30-day average, which is required to answer your query precisely. However, I can outline the method you should use to calculate this percentage, given the data:\n\n1. **Calculate the 30-day average daily volume** by summing the daily volumes over the last 30 days and dividing by 30[2].\n2. **Determine the threshold**: Twice the 30-day average volume.\n3. **Count the number of days** in the period where the daily volume exceeded this threshold.\n4. **Calculate the percentage**: Divide the number of days with volume above the threshold by 30, then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nFor example, if the 30-day average volume is $60M and there were 4 days in the last month where the daily volume exceeded $120M, then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\frac{4}{30} \\times 100 \\approx 13.33\\%\n\\]\n\nBased on the limited recent volume data in the search results, we see July 8 had a volume of $151.72M[3] and July 9 had $87.60M[1], but without the full 30-day series, an exact calculation isn't possible.\n\n**If you have access to the 30-day daily volume data, apply the above method for a precise answer.** If you provide the full volume data, I can compute the exact percentage for you.",
  "eth_largest_gap_open_close": "The available search results do not provide specific historical candle data for Ethereum (ETH) over the past 30 days, including **individual opening and closing prices needed to directly calculate the largest positive or negative gap between previous close and next open** as a percentage. Without granular daily price data, the exact value for the largest gap cannot be determined from the provided sources.\n\nHowever, if you can access historical ETH price data\u2014particularly the daily close and next open prices\u2014you can calculate the largest gap as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gap (\\%)} = \\frac{\\text{Open}_{n} - \\text{Close}_{n-1}}{\\text{Close}_{n-1}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\text{Close}_{n-1}\\) = closing price of day \\(n-1\\)\n- \\(\\text{Open}_{n}\\) = opening price of day \\(n\\)\n\nYou would:\n- Calculate this percentage for each day in the 30-day period,\n- Identify the **day with the highest positive percentage** (largest upwards gap) and the **day with the lowest (most negative) percentage** (largest downwards gap).\n\nAt this time, based on the search results and without direct access to the 30-day ETH price candle data, a precise percentage value for the largest positive or negative gap cannot be given.",
  "sol_days_close_above_10dma": "Based on the provided search results, there is **no explicit data stating the exact percentage of days that SOL closed above its 10-day moving average during the past 30-day period**. The available sources discuss overall trends, moving averages, and technical outlooks but do not present detailed day-by-day statistics or summaries for this specific metric[1][5].\n\nFrom the TradingView summary as of July 10, 2025, the technical analysis shows that **moving averages for SOL currently indicate a \"strong buy\"**, which typically means the price has been consistently trading above key moving averages, including shorter-term MAs like the 10-day[5]. However, without a precise data table or published statistic, **the exact percentage cannot be determined solely from these search results**.\n\nIf you need the exact figure, you would typically analyze historical price data by:\n- Downloading daily SOL closing prices for the last 30 days.\n- Calculating the 10-day moving average for each day.\n- Counting the number of days the closing price was above the 10-day MA.\n- Dividing that count by 30 to get the percentage.\n\nGiven the technical summary indicates **current bullish momentum** and a \"strong buy\" from moving averages, it's reasonable to infer that a majority of days in the recent period saw SOL closing above its 10-day MA, but **the precise percentage cannot be confirmed from the provided sources**[5].",
  "rank_by_max_intraday_swing": "Based on the available data for the past 30 days, here\u2019s the ranking of **SOL, ETH, and TAO** by their largest single-day high-low percentage swing:\n\n### 1. **Solana (SOL)**\n- **Largest daily swing:** Over **6%**  \n- On a recent Saturday, SOL rose **over 6%**, followed by nearly a 2% increase on Sunday. Additionally, there was a daily drop of **over 5%** on the following Tuesday, showing that days with swings above 5% are not uncommon for SOL in this period[3].\n\n### 2. **Ethereum (ETH)**\n- **Largest daily swing:** Data not specified, but recent volatility suggests swings smaller than SOL\u2019s  \n- No single-day percentage swing for ETH larger than SOL\u2019s 6% has been reported in the relevant period. ETH\u2019s moves have generally mirrored market sentiment but with less dramatic daily percentage swings compared to SOL[1][3].\n\n### 3. **Bittensor (TAO)**\n- **Largest daily swing:** Not reported in the provided results  \n- The search results do not provide any direct high-low percentage swing data for TAO in the last 30 days. Without specific evidence, it must be ranked last, pending further data[3].\n\n**Ranking by largest single-day high-low percentage swing in the last 30 days:**\n\n| Rank | Asset | Largest Daily Swing (Approx.) |\n|------|-------|:-----------------------------:|\n| 1    | SOL   | **Over 6%**                  |\n| 2    | ETH   | *Smaller than SOL, not specified* |\n| 3    | TAO   | *No data available*          |\n\n> SOL stands out for the highest single-day volatility in the past month, with daily swings exceeding 6%[3].

For such a calculation, explicit daily closing prices for each asset for each of the past 30 days are required\u2014allowing you to count the days when all three closed higher than the day before.\n\n- SOL and ETH show **strong gains over Q2 2025** (24.5% and 36.1% respectively)[4], with some daily volatility outlined for SOL in April 2025[3].\n- TAO only has **monthly average price forecasts** and their expected ranges, not daily closes[1].\n\nWithout complete and aligned daily close data for SOL, ETH, and TAO, an accurate percentage cannot be computed from these sources.\n\nIf you have access to daily closing price data for these three assets, you could:\n1. For each day in the 30-day period (excluding the first), check if SOL, ETH, and TAO each closed higher than the previous day.\n2. Count the number of days this condition is met.\n3. Divide that count by 29 (or 30, depending on your counting method) to get the percentage.\n\nIf you provide the daily close data, I can perform this calculation for you.",
