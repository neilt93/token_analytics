  "pct_days_both_sol_eth_green_30d": "To determine the percentage of days during which both SOL and ETH closed higher than the previous day from June 9 to July 8, 2025, you would need to analyze the daily closing prices for both cryptocurrencies over that 30-day period. \n\nAssuming you have access to this data, you would:\n\n1. Count the number of days both SOL and ETH closed higher than their respective previous day's closing prices.\n2. Divide that count by 30 (the total number of days in the period).\n3. Multiply the result by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\nFor example, if both SOL and ETH closed higher on 12 out of the 30 days, the calculation would be:\n\n(12 / 30) * 100 = 40%\n\nWithout the specific data, I can't provide the exact percentage, but this is the method you would use to calculate it.",

  "tao_biggest_weekly_gain": "To determine the calendar week within the 30-day window that saw TAO's largest 7-day percentage gain, I would need specific price data for TAO over that period. However, since I don't have access to real-time data or specific historical data beyond my training, I can't provide the exact week or percentage gain. You would need to analyze the price data for TAO over the past 30 days, calculate the percentage change for each 7-day period, and identify the week with the highest gain.",

  "tao_max_5d_rolling_return": "I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific cryptocurrency price data or calculations for TAO or any other asset. To determine the highest 5-day rolling return for TAO during a specific 30-day period, you would need to analyze the historical price data for that period. You can calculate the 5-day rolling return by taking the percentage change in price over each 5-day window and then identifying the maximum value from those calculations.",
  "sol_min_3d_rolling_return": "I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific cryptocurrency price data or rolling return calculations for SOL or any other asset. You would need to access a financial data platform or use historical price data to calculate the 3-day rolling returns for SOL over the desired 30-day period.",
  "sol_highest_volume_zscore_day": "To determine the day SOL recorded the highest positive volume z-score relative to its 30-day mean, you would need access to the specific volume data for SOL over the relevant period. This involves calculating the z-score for each day by taking the difference between the day's volume and the 30-day mean volume, then dividing by the 30-day standard deviation of the volume. Unfortunately, I don't have access to real-time or historical data to provide the exact day. You would need to perform this calculation using a dataset from a financial data provider or a cryptocurrency exchange.",
  "eth_avg_volume_when_sol_drop_gt5": "To provide an accurate answer, I would need specific data from the 30-day period in question, including the dates when SOL fell more than 5% and the corresponding ETH trading volumes on those days. If you have this data, I can help you calculate the average daily volume for ETH on those specific days. Otherwise, I recommend checking a reliable financial data source or platform that tracks cryptocurrency trading volumes to obtain this information.",
  "tao_highest_intraday_swing_date": "To determine the date on which TAO experienced its largest single-day high-low swing during a 30-day period, you would need to analyze the daily high and low prices for each day within that timeframe. Unfortunately, I don't have access to specific daily price data for TAO. You would need to review the historical price data from a financial data provider or cryptocurrency exchange to identify the date with the largest difference between the high and low prices.",
  "eth_days_range_gt5pct": "To determine how many days Ethereum's (ETH) intraday range exceeded 5% of its closing price during a specific 30-day period, you would need to analyze the daily high, low, and closing prices for each of those days. Unfortunately, I don't have access to real-time or historical data to provide a specific number for this period. You would need to access a financial data platform or use historical price data from a source like CoinMarketCap or a similar service to perform this calculation.",
  "pct_sol_close_above_7dma": "To determine the percentage of days SOL closed above its 7-day moving average during a 30-day period, you would need to analyze the daily closing prices and the corresponding 7-day moving averages for each day within that period. \n\nIf you have the data, you can calculate the number of days SOL's closing price was above its 7-day moving average, divide that by 30, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. \n\nFor example, if SOL closed above its 7-day moving average on 18 out of 30 days, the calculation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{18}{30}\\right) \\times 100 = 60\\%\n\\]\n\nWithout specific data, I can't provide the exact percentage. If you have the data, you can apply this method to find the answer.",

  "rank_by_total_return_30d": "To rank SOL, ETH, and TAO by total percentage return over a 30-day window, I would need the specific price data for each cryptocurrency at the start and end of the 30-day period. If you provide these prices, I can calculate the percentage return for each and rank them accordingly.",
  "rank_by_volatility_30d": "To rank SOL, ETH, and TAO by their highest 30-day price-range percentage (volatility), we need to calculate the percentage difference between the highest and lowest prices for each cryptocurrency over the 30-day period.\n\nAssuming we have the following hypothetical data for the 30-day period:\n\n- **SOL**: Highest price = $30, Lowest price = $20\n- **ETH**: Highest price = $2,000, Lowest price = $1,500\n- **TAO**: Highest price = $10, Lowest price = $7\n\nWe calculate the 30-day price-range percentage for each:\n\n- **SOL**: \\[((30 - 20) / 20) * 100\\] = 50%\n- **ETH**: \\[((2000 - 1500) / 1500) * 100\\] = 33.33%\n- **TAO**: \\[((10 - 7) / 7) * 100\\] = 42.86%\n\nRanking by highest volatility:\n\n1. **SOL**: 50%\n2. **TAO**: 42.86%\n3. **ETH**: 33.33%\n\nTherefore, SOL has the highest 30-day price-range percentage, followed by TAO, and then ETH.",
  "pct_sol_above_160_when_eth_above_2700": "To determine the percentage of days SOL closed above $160 on days when ETH closed above $2,700 during a specific 30-day period, you would need the daily closing prices for both SOL and ETH for those 30 days.\n\nAssuming you have this data, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the days when ETH closed above $2,700.\n2. Count how many of those days SOL also closed above $160.\n3. Divide the number of days SOL closed above $160 by the total number of days ETH closed above $2,700.\n4.
