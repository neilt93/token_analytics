You would need to analyze the price data from a reliable financial data source or platform that tracks TAO's daily price movements to identify the date with the largest high-low swing.",
  "eth_days_range_gt5pct": "To determine how many days Ethereum's (ETH) intraday range exceeded 5% of its closing price during a 30-day period, you would need to analyze the daily high, low, and closing prices for each of those days. Specifically, you would calculate the intraday range as a percentage of the closing price for each day and count the number of days where this percentage exceeds 5%.\n\nUnfortunately, without specific data from the 30-day period in question, I cannot provide an exact number. You would need to access historical price data for ETH, perform the calculations, and count the qualifying days.",
  "pct_sol_close_above_7dma": "To determine the percentage of days SOL closed above its 7-day moving average during a 30-day period, you would need to analyze the daily closing prices of SOL and its corresponding 7-day moving averages for those 30 days. \n\nIf you have the data, you can calculate it by counting the number of days SOL's closing price was higher than its 7-day moving average and then dividing that count by 30 (the total number of days in the period). Finally, multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nFor example, if SOL closed above its 7-day moving average on 18 out of 30 days, the calculation would be:\n\n(18 / 30) * 100 = 60%\n\nThis means SOL closed above its 7-day moving average on 60% of the days during that period. If you provide the specific data, I can help with the calculation.",

You can do this by obtaining the daily returns and standard deviations for each cryptocurrency and then dividing the average daily return by the daily standard deviation for each one. This will give you the Sharpe ratio, which you can then use to rank them.",
  "rank_by_total_return_30d": "To rank SOL, ETH, and TAO by total percentage return over a 30-day window, I would need the specific price data for each cryptocurrency at the start and end of the 30-day period. If you provide these prices, I can calculate the percentage return for each and rank them accordingly.",
  "rank_by_volatility_30d": "To rank SOL, ETH, and TAO by their highest 30-day price-range percentage (volatility), you would need to calculate the percentage difference between the highest and lowest prices for each cryptocurrency over the 30-day period. Unfortunately, I don't have real-time data access to provide the exact figures. However, you can obtain this information from a financial data provider or cryptocurrency exchange platform that offers historical price data.
