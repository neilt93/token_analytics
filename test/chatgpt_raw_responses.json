For accurate and up-to-date cryptocurrency price data, I recommend checking a reliable financial data service or cryptocurrency exchange platform.",
  "pct_days_both_sol_eth_green_30d": "To determine the percentage of days during which both SOL and ETH closed higher than the previous day from June 9 to July 8, 2025, you would need to analyze the daily closing prices for both cryptocurrencies over that 30-day period. \n\nAssuming you have access to this data, you would:\n\n1. Count the number of days both SOL and ETH closed higher than their respective previous day's closing prices.\n2. Divide that count by 30 (the total number of days in the period).\n3. Multiply the result by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\nFor example, if both SOL and ETH closed higher on 12 out of the 30 days, the calculation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{12}{30}\\right) \\times 100 = 40\\%\n\\]\n\nWithout the specific data, I can't provide the exact percentage, but this is the method you would use to calculate it.",

  "tao_biggest_weekly_gain": "To determine the calendar week within the 30-day window that saw TAO's largest 7-day percentage gain, I would need specific price data for TAO over that period. However, since I don't have access to real-time data or specific historical data beyond October 2023, I can't provide the exact week or percentage gain. You would need to analyze the price data for TAO over the past 30 days, calculate the percentage change for each 7-day period, and identify the week with the highest gain.",

Unfortunately, I don't have access to real-time or historical data beyond my training cut-off in October 2023. You can calculate the 3-day rolling return by taking the percentage change over each 3-day window within the 30-day period and then identifying the lowest value. You might want to use a financial data platform or a spreadsheet tool to perform this calculation with the available data.",
  "sol_highest_volume_zscore_day": "To determine the day SOL recorded the highest positive volume z-score relative to its 30-day mean, you would need to calculate the z-score for each day over a specific period. The z-score is calculated by subtracting the 30-day mean volume from the daily volume and then dividing by the 30-day standard deviation of the volume.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have access to real-time data or specific historical data calculations. You would need to access a financial data platform or use a tool like Python with libraries such as Pandas to calculate this using historical volume data for SOL.",

Calculate 5% of the closing price: 0.05 * Closing Price.\n3. Check if the intraday range exceeds 5% of the closing price.\n\nWithout access to the specific historical data for the 30-day period in question, I cannot provide the exact number of days. You would need to analyze the data using the steps above to find the answer.",
  "pct_sol_close_above_7dma": "To calculate the percentage of days SOL closed above its 7-day moving average during a 30-day period, you would need to compare the closing price of SOL for each day with its 7-day moving average for that day.

To determine the 30-day Sharpe ratio for these cryptocurrencies, you would need to calculate it using historical price data for that specific period. The Sharpe ratio is calculated by taking the average daily return, subtracting the risk-free rate (often assumed to be zero for simplicity in crypto markets), and dividing by the standard deviation of daily returns over the period. You can obtain this data from financial databases or cryptocurrency exchanges that provide historical price information.",
  "rank_by_total_return_30d": "To rank SOL, ETH, and TAO by total percentage return over a 30-day window, I would need the specific price data for each cryptocurrency at the start and end of the 30-day period.

  "rank_by_volatility_30d": "To rank SOL, ETH, and TAO by their highest 30-day price-range percentage (volatility), we need to calculate the percentage difference between the highest and lowest prices for each cryptocurrency over the 30-day period.\n\nAssuming we have the following hypothetical data for the 30-day period:\n\n- **SOL**: Highest price = $25, Lowest price = $20\n- **ETH**: Highest price = $1,800, Lowest price = $1,500\n- **TAO**: Highest price = $2, Lowest price = $1.50\n\nWe calculate the price-range percentage for each:\n\n- **SOL**: \\[((25 - 20) / 20) \\times 100\\] = 25%\n- **ETH**: \\[((1,800 - 1,500) / 1,500) \\times 100\\] = 20%\n- **TAO**: \\[((2 - 1.50) / 1.50) \\times 100\\] = 33.33%\n\nRanking by highest 30-day price-range percentage:\n\n1. **TAO**: 33.33%\n2. **SOL**: 25%\n3. **ETH**: 20%\n\nTherefore, TAO has the highest volatility, followed by SOL and ETH.",
  "pct_sol_above_160_when_eth_above_2700": "To determine the percentage of days SOL closed above $160 on days when ETH closed above $2,700 during a specific 30-day period, you would need to analyze the daily closing prices of both SOL and ETH for that period.

However, if you have access to the daily opening and closing prices for SOL (Solana) over the specified period, you can determine the number of days it closed at or above its opening price by counting the days where the closing price was greater than or equal to the opening price. If you have this data, I can help guide you on how to analyze it.",
  "pct_days_tao_vol_gt_2x_avg": "I'm sorry, but I don't have access to real-time or specific historical data on TAO's daily volume or its 30-day average volume. To determine the percentage of days where TAO's daily volume exceeded twice its 30-day average, you would need to analyze the trading volume data over a specific period. This can typically be done using financial data platforms or tools that provide historical trading data for cryptocurrencies.",
  "eth_largest_gap_open_close": "To determine the largest gap between the previous close and the next open for Ethereum (ETH) during a 30-day period, you would need to analyze the daily price data for that specific timeframe.

Unfortunately, I don't have access to real-time data or specific historical data beyond my training cut-off in October 2023. However, you can calculate this by obtaining the daily closing prices for SOL over the 30-day period, calculating the 10-day moving average for each day, and then counting the number of days the closing price was above the moving average.
