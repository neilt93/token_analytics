Therefore, I cannot provide the percentage of days SOL was below $140 during the specified period in 2025. You would need to access a financial data platform or historical price data to determine this information.",
  "pct_days_both_sol_eth_green_30d": "To determine the percentage of days during which both SOL and ETH closed higher than the previous day from June 9 to July 8, 2025, you would need to analyze the daily closing prices for both cryptocurrencies over that period. Unfortunately, I don't have access to future data or specific daily price movements beyond my training data, which goes up to October 2023. You would need to access a financial data platform or historical price database to calculate the exact percentage for that period.",

  "tao_biggest_weekly_gain": "To determine the calendar week within the 30-day window that saw TAO's largest 7-day percentage gain, I would need specific price data for TAO over that period. However, since I don't have access to real-time data, I can't provide the exact week or percentage gain. You would need to analyze the price data for TAO over the past 30 days, calculate the percentage change for each 7-day period, and identify the week with the highest gain.",

  "tao_max_5d_rolling_return": "I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific cryptocurrency price data or calculations for TAO or any other asset. To determine the highest 5-day rolling return for TAO during a specific 30-day period, you would need to analyze historical price data for that period. You can calculate the 5-day rolling return by taking the percentage change in price over each 5-day window and then identifying the maximum value from those calculations.",
  "sol_min_3d_rolling_return": "I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific cryptocurrency price data or rolling return calculations for SOL or any other asset. You would need to analyze historical price data from a financial data provider or platform to determine the lowest 3-day rolling return for SOL during a specific 30-day period.",
  "sol_highest_volume_zscore_day": "To determine the specific day when SOL recorded the highest positive volume z-score relative to its 30-day mean, you would need access to historical trading volume data for SOL. This involves calculating the z-score for each day by taking the difference between the daily volume and the 30-day mean volume, then dividing by the 30-day standard deviation of the volume. Unfortunately, I don't have real-time data access to provide the exact date. You would need to perform this analysis using a financial data platform or service that provides historical volume data for SOL.",
  "eth_avg_volume_when_sol_drop_gt5": "To determine ETH's average daily volume on the days when SOL fell more than 5% during a specific 30-day period, you would need access to historical trading data for both Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) for that timeframe. This data is typically available on cryptocurrency exchanges or financial data platforms.\n\nHowever, as I don't have real-time data access or the ability to browse the internet, I can't provide specific numbers. You would need to extract the relevant data from a source like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, or a similar platform, filter the days when SOL's price dropped more than 5%, and then calculate the average daily trading volume for ETH on those days.",
  "tao_highest_intraday_swing_date": "To determine the date on which TAO experienced its largest single-day high-low swing during a 30-day period, you would need to examine the daily high and low prices for each day within that timeframe. Unfortunately, I don't have access to specific daily price data for TAO. You would need to analyze the historical price data from a financial data provider or cryptocurrency exchange to identify the exact date.",
  "eth_days_range_gt5pct": "To determine how many days Ethereum's (ETH) intraday range exceeded 5% of its closing price during a specific 30-day period, you would need to analyze the daily high, low, and closing prices for each of those days. Unfortunately, I don't have access to real-time or specific historical data. However, you can calculate this by following these steps:\n\n1. For each day, calculate the intraday range: \\( \\text{Intraday Range} = \\text{High} - \\text{Low} \\).\n2. Calculate 5% of the closing price: \\( 0.05 \\times \\text{Closing Price} \\).\n3. Compare the intraday range to 5% of the closing price.\n4. Count the number of days where the intraday range exceeds 5% of the closing price.\n\nYou can obtain the necessary historical price data from financial data providers or cryptocurrency exchanges to perform this analysis.",
  "pct_sol_close_above_7dma": "To determine the percentage of days SOL closed above its 7-day moving average during a 30-day period, you would need to analyze the daily closing prices of SOL and its corresponding 7-day moving average for each of those days. \n\nIf you have this data, you can calculate the number of days SOL closed above its 7-day moving average and then divide that by 30 (the total number of days in the period) to get the percentage. \n\nFor example, if SOL closed above its 7-day moving average on 18 out of 30 days, the calculation would be:\n\n(18 / 30) * 100 = 60%\n\nWithout specific data, I can't provide the exact percentage, but this is the method you would use to find it.",

  "rank_by_total_return_30d": "To rank SOL, ETH, and TAO by total percentage return over a 30-day window, we need the specific price data for each cryptocurrency at the start and end of the period. Without this data, I can't provide an accurate ranking. If you have the starting and ending prices for each, I can help calculate the percentage returns and rank them accordingly.",
  "rank_by_volatility_30d": "To rank SOL, ETH, and TAO by their highest 30-day price-range percentage (volatility), we need to calculate the percentage difference between the highest and lowest prices for each cryptocurrency over the 30-day period.\n\nAssuming we have the following hypothetical data for the 30-day period:\n\n- **SOL (Solana):**\n  - Highest Price: $35\n  - Lowest Price: $25\n  - Price-Range Percentage: \\(((35 - 25) / 25) \\times 100 = 40\\%\\)\n\n- **ETH (Ethereum):**\n  - Highest Price: $1,800\n  - Lowest Price: $1,500\n  - Price-Range Percentage: \\(((1,800 - 1,500) / 1,500) \\times 100 = 20\\%\\)\n\n- **TAO:**\n  - Highest Price: $2.50\n  - Lowest Price: $1.50\n  - Price-Range Percentage: \\(((2.50 - 1.50) / 1.50) \\times 100 = 66.67\\%\\)\n\nBased on these calculations, the ranking by highest 30-day price-range percentage (volatility) is:\n\n1. **TAO** - 66.67%\n2. **SOL** - 40%\n3. **ETH** - 20%",
  "pct_sol_above_160_when_eth_above_2700": "To determine the percentage of days SOL closed above $160 on days ETH closed above $2,700 during a specific 30-day period, you would need to analyze the daily closing prices of both SOL and ETH for that timeframe. Unfortunately, I don't have access to real-time or historical market data to provide specific numbers. You would need to obtain the daily closing prices for both cryptocurrencies over the 30-day period in question and calculate the percentage based on those figures.",
