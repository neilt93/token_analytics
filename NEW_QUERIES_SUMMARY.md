## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### LLM-based Extraction Support
All new queries are fully supported by the LLM-based evaluation system:

```python
# Example usage
evaluator = TokenAnalyticsEvaluator(llm_api_key="your-key")

result = evaluator.evaluate_agent_response(
    query_id="pct_days_sol_up_eth_down",
    agent_response="SOL closed higher while ETH closed lower on 3.45% of days",
    agent_name="My Agent"
)
```

### Category-Specific Parsing
- **conditional_threshold**: Extracts percentages
- **volatility**: Extracts numbers or tokens
- **streak_analysis**: Extracts numbers
- **rolling_stats**: Extracts percentages
- **performance_comparison**: Extracts rankings
- **volume_analysis**: Extracts percentages or tokens
- **volatility_stat**: Extracts numbers
- **conditional_volume**: Extracts numbers

## ðŸ“ˆ Testing

### Test the New Queries
```bash
# Test new queries with LLM evaluation
python test/test_new_queries.py

# Run full evaluation with all 30 queries
python run_evaluations.py
```

### Expected Results
The new queries should work seamlessly with the LLM-based extraction system, providing:

- âœ… **Accurate parsing** of natural language responses
